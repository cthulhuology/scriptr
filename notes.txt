scriptr notes

- explanantion of how to setup Github access token w/ correct permissions missing
- github repo initialization can get in a weird state, need to add files
- clicking run should save & run
- initializing a global as a number is difficult as you MUST set to a number first.
- console.log doesn't take a variable number of args
- doesn't seem like you can stick arrays in globals contrary to documentation

	if (!storage.global.traffic) {
	  storage.global.traffic = new Array();
	}

- arrays are getting serialized and failing.
